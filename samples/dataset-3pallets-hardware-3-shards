# SIZE indicates a fixed assignation of duties to pallets, just for test
# WEIGHT indicates an absolute or random weight between a range 0~N
# BALANCER valid values are: 
# 	FAIR_WEIGHT	assignation of duties according weights and nodes capacities
#	EVEN_WEIGHT	same duty total weight to each shard regardless of capacities (non asked)
#	EVEN_SIZE	same number of duties to all shards
#	SPILL_OVER	increasing duty assignation to shards in order of fulfilling
#	COALESCE	shard agglutination of duties of the same pallet
#	SCATTER		shuffling assignation of duties
