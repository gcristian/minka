# this file is read at the sample module, by the DatasetSampler class.
# for locally sampling Minka with a testing static data

=============================================
# the different nodes named as their listening ports
# run `./newsampler` 3 times, each process will grab the next port
shards.ports = 9000;9001;9002

=============================================

# distribution of duties among the pallets

# SIZE indicates a fixed assignation of duties to pallets, just for test
# WEIGHT indicates an absolute or random weight between a range 0~N and in the same measure than shard capacities
# BALANCER valid values are: 
# 	FAIR_WEIGHT	assignation of duties according weights and nodes capacities
#	EVEN_WEIGHT	same duty total weight to each shard regardless of capacities (non asked)
#	EVEN_SIZE	same number of duties to all shards
#	SPILL_OVER	progressive cluster usage by duty agluttination until completion
#	COALESCE	shard agglutination of duties of the same pallet
#	SHUFFLE_ONCE	shuffling assignation of duties
#              NAME    SIZE     WEIGHT   BALANCER
