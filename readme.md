### What is Minka ?
Minka is a Java library for distribution and balance of backend systems through sharding of user-defined duties. 
### What is it used for ?

Horizontally scale up usage of physical resources by splitting processing workload into application instances, and keeping a dynamic distribution and balancing of input signals.  

###Features
- Highly available service of distribution of duties and Resilient to failure
- Several weighted balancers to achieve flexible and continuous dynamic task distribution
- Mutipurpose abstract model with an Inversion of Control non-intrusive integration
- Isolation of scaling concerns out of the business layer by encapsulation

|user-defined distributable entities, representing input data or signal to user functions.|group duties, with specific balancing strategies based on lifecycle, costs and performance. |the API client applying the contract of reacting on distribution events sent to the shard|fragments of the duty universe, each machine in the cluster. | coordinates client CRUD requests. Controls everything.| receives duties and pallets from the leader, to invoke delegate's contract.
